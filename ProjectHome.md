This project is in developing processor.
Current version is Alpha 1.0.

---


To test this project, you should do the following steps:

1. Download and install Wordpress version 3.5.1. Link download here: http://wordpress.org/download/

2. Checkout Cootheme into **wp-content/themes/**

This is link to checkout: **svn checkout https://cootheme2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cootheme**

3. Run test: http://your_localhost/your_wordpress

Cootheme provides a collection of entities that mapped Wordpress's data to objects. It also provides a collection of models, controllers, views, helpers...

Unfortunately, now it misses some helps and tutorials. I will update as soon as.
